[] whisker 2.1

- Fixed a bug in sec2print() (minutes weren't printed), found by
filipe[at]rnl.ist.utl.pt

- Incorrectly referencing 'targate' instead of 'target'.  Found by
backd_1600[at]yahoo.fr.

- *Tons* of other changes--so many it's not worth individually documenting,
since 2.0 was alpha and 2.1 made many overhauls of entire subsystems.

- Finally got around to the start of the documentation.

- Added the newbie.help guided configuration walkthrough, for all those
who are lost without prompts and/or a GUI.

- Lots of .test updates, although not as many new signatures as other scanners. I am also not including checks for files which are vulnerable for cross-site scripting.
